# Let's Go!

Let's Go! is a live stream series with [@arschles](https://github.com/arschles) and [iennae](https://github.com/iennae). We cover a wide variety of topics, but we're always talking about all things [Go](https://golang.org)!

Screencasts happen every Monday at 11:00am US Pacific Time, on [twitch.tv/arschles](https://twitch.tv/arschles).

You can see the time of the stream in your time zone on [time.is](https://time.is/compare/1100am_6_July_2020_in_Portland,_Oregon). Just make sure to change the date to the appropriate day of the stream and it should automatically show you the right time for your time zone.
